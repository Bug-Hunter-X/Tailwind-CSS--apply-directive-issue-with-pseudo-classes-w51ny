This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector like `:hover`, `:focus`, or `:active`.  The `@apply` directive will apply the styles from the class to the element, but only when the element isn't actually in the `:hover`, `:focus`, or `:active` state.  This leads to the styles not working as expected.

```css
/* This class will not be applied when the element is not hovering */
.btn-hover {
  @apply hover:bg-blue-500;
}
```
